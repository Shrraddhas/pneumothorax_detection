Pneumothorax Detection and Segmentation using CNN with LIME
This project focuses on detecting and segmenting pneumothorax in chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We use interpretability techniques like LIME and SHAP to explain the predictions made by the model.

Dataset
We have used the SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax Segmentation dataset provided by Kaggle.

Dataset Link: SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax Segmentation

This dataset consists of chest X-ray images along with pixel-level segmentation masks indicating the presence of pneumothorax.

Steps Taken in the Project
Data Loading and Preprocessing

Images and corresponding masks were loaded.

Resizing of images for model input.

Dataset split into training and validation sets.

Model Building

Implemented a U-Net architecture with a pretrained encoder for segmentation.

Used Binary Cross-Entropy and Dice loss for optimization.

Training the Model

Trained the model using the prepared dataset.

Used callbacks like EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint to prevent overfitting.

Evaluation

Evaluated on validation set using Dice coefficient and IoU metrics.

Interpretability

Used LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to explain local predictions.

Applied SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for feature importance visualization.

Prediction and Visualization

Generated predicted masks on test images.

Visualized original image, ground truth mask, and predicted mask side by side.
